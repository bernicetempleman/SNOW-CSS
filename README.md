- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets 
- It is a language for styling HTML documents by specifying certain rules for layout and display in key/value pairs. 
- Style Sheets are a simple and powerful method of allowing attachment of rendering information to HTML documents. 
- It used to style the webpages by setting background-color, font color, font size, font family, etc.
- A CSS consists of a set of rules that defines the styles for a web page. 
- A CSS style rule composed of selectors and declarations. 
- The selector is an HTML Element like h3 used in the below example. 
- The declaration is comprised of a property and a value surrounded by curly braces.

## CSS Box Model
- The CSS box model used to determine how our web page is rendered by browser. 
- It considers each element on the page as a box, CSS allows you to apply different properties that define where and how that element appears. 
- Web pages are made up of rectangular boxes arranged and related to each other.
- Every box has 4 parts - margin, border, padding and content. 
- The margin is an outermost box, inside that the border, then padding, then the content is innermost. 
- All box sizes/formatting can be styled with CSS.

- Margin - It is a space between border and margin. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors. The dimensions are given by the margin-box width and the margin-box height.
- Border - It is the area between the boxâ€™s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.
- Padding - It is a space around the content area and within the border-box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.
- Content - It consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content-box width and height

## Types of CSS
There are three types of CSS which are given below:

## Internal or embedded CSS
This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. 
The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.

## External CSS
- External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes.
- CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. 
- This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.

```
- We have HTML file that makes use of the above created external style sheet (style.css). 
- This can be achieved by using <link> tag. 
- The <link> element has rel and href attributes. 
- The rel specifices the relationship between the current document and the linked document. 
- In this case, rel attribute value will be stylesheet because we going to add the external style sheet to the HTML document. 
- The href attribute is used to specify the location of the external style sheet file.
```
